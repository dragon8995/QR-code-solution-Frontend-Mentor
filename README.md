## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

#### 學習 git 使用

- VS Code 內使用從左邊 git 圖示進行 commit 即可
- src: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview

#### 回憶外部 CSS 連結方式

```
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
```

#### CSS Reset

```

```

#### 糊塗的搞錯語法

- img 是在.card 標籤下面，打錯結果沒有吃到 CSS

#### a 標籤新分頁

```
<a href="url" target="_blank"></a>
```

#### 引入字型

去 google font 找需要的字型，並在 header 嵌入（註：Outfit 特別好看）
